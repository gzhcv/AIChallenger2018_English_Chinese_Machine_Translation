i haven 't been back here since ...

is it ? how convenient . - what ?
all right , you can walk out of here anyway you want .

sarah , just because i hear what he has to say does not make me the village idiot .
i ’ m sorry , fi . i just i found a thread , and when i pulled at it michael , i ’ m worried .

what are you talking about ? - recognize that boat , pig ?
oh , i 'm sorry you had to go to that trouble , ma 'am .
co@@ op and i stayed around looking for you , but , uh , you obviously went somewhere .
you know , i would be , but it seems that a rival cartel got an anonymous shipment of a@@ k-@@ 4@@ 7@@ s and rocket laun@@ chers , so those angry south americans were a little busy , what with all the killing and dying .
i made an eagle and a flag , too .
the freak actually came through , huh ?
looks like the storm took out the cell towers .
tell him you can 't stay . - i 'd love to . thank you , sir .
i guess with simon , you have to expect the unexpected .
according to nora , there 's been some misunderstanding .
a small , little , almost gel@@ at@@ in@@ ous@@ -@@ looking creature ...
that i developed over two seasons of fighting in the oc@@ ta@@ gon .
we@@ -- we don '@@ t-- we don 't have to talk .
so here 's what we know about the kra@@ ken .
i had the box in my hands , then i decided you never will . ever .
why is he looking at us ?
l 'll even throw in some hot chocolate with those little tiny marsh@@ mal@@ lows .
i-i am a terrible liar , justin .
sarah , come here . i want you to look at this . - what ?
you 'll be lucky enough to manage ...
you thinking about sticking around for a while ?
so mrs. king is coming up the stairs with her groceries , and the shooter 's here ... ... and he takes her out before she has a chance to witness anything .
no , no , i don 't . i like him the exact right amount for some one who i just met this morning .
we already did last time we were here . how do you think i found you ?
every cop , sheriff 's deputy , and meter maid in the country will be up your ass unless you do exactly what our friend wants .
smart . or better yet , have a -- have a friend call your cell phone like 15 minutes into the date .
nora . - i don 't know . i started to think it was all a dream@@ -- whatever we were .
yes , i put vin@@ e@@ gar in the water . i do know how to po@@ ach an egg .
she could be anywhere . uh , actually , i think we have a lead .
we can check you in under a fake name .
i 'll be back . i 'm just ... gonna get a little air .
so what kind of damage could a kra@@ ken hook do to a wood boat ?
it doesn 't matter what he thought .
thank you . - hey , no problem .
blood of my heart , my tide , my moon ...
bailey 's testimony could cut the head off their organization , and they know it .
i gotta get back up to my floor , but congratulations .
i 'm feeling very un@@ c , so ... good night .
a-@@ actually , it '@@ s-- it 's kinda crazy you should say that . um ...
um , e man and woman play their parts , but ...
since when does a washing machine need an l. c.@@ d. screen ?
well , you know , we 're making money .
it 's gonna totally revolution@@ ize the golf club -- forget it .
l 'm not really dressed for a job interview right now .
which is why there 's nothing quite so un@@ settling as seeing one of those secrets show up in the wrong place at the wrong time .
but you don '@@ tha@@ ve to evacuate . you just have to ... stay here with me .
but the fact is , tom card called an un@@ sanc@@ tioned hit , and my brother was collateral damage .
they were talking about this boat . - yeah , i re@@ mber the name sky@@ lar@@ k ii .
cole ! get out of the water !
what 's the sad@@ dest thing you 've ever seen ?
if they haven 't been spotted yet , they 've broken the perimeter .
if there 's one thing nate west@@ en knows how to do , it 's avoid telling the truth .
and while we can 't di@@ min@@ ish the seri@@ ousness of what their children are going through , we can ease their financial burden a bit and give them a friendly , safe place to stay .
excuse me . i need you to get to class .
i should run . - yeah ? super-@@ secret spy meeting ?
honey , i need you to help me .
do you remember the meeting i took - with the institute for republican thought ? - an oxy@@ moron , but , yes .
okay . good . that 's what i ’ ll tell my friend .
attached to the ru@@ dder of the boat ?
fear keeps us doub@@ ting instead of hoping , looking down instead of up , and this evening is all about looking up , so look down only long enough to fill out your contribution form .
fruit and vegetables are my life . you look great .
she just offered us a way to save ourselves .
but i didn '@@ t-- - [ indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t ]
you plan on being a writer ? - i don 't know yet . maybe .
you were the one who ro@@ ped her into dealing with the russian bureau@@ crat to help free son@@ ya , and she crushed it , by the way .
well , of course you 're terrified . it 's a big step .
i have no idea how they did it .
my way of doing things doesn 't work for the boy scouts .
i knew i should have shot that fisher@@ man .
nobody 's ever seen one of these hunt .
riley knows that i 'm hurt , so she 's going to be watching the hospitals to see if i turn up .
what can l say ? l am a pathetic disaster , and l give up .
have i ever said no to putting goo@@ p on my face ? come on .
it 's the enemy out there , not in here .
justin , i know you go to your n. a. meetings and you talk about everything , and i think that 's great .
live forever . forget what you 've forgotten .
yes , he is handsome , and you know what ?
that makes him my team@@ mate on this .
when you need to capture a target in a building , one of the most effective techniques is known as the hammer and an@@ vi@@ l .
and now you sound like dad .
you wait for my signal and then you move .
and if i somehow gave cancer the opportunity to grow inside my body , then i have a responsibility to change .
usually in cases like this we wouldn 't expect to find them alive .
so we still feel@@ in ' pretty good about this , uh , 3 2-@@ piece set here ?
lots of chances to get seen .
justin sets his mind on something ... it doesn 't matter how wrong it is ...
look , i don 't care if you 're working . holly 's more important .
to get him an invitation on account of his ...
we might have if cole hadn 't gotten away .
pai@@ ge , go upstairs and@@ --and take that off .
we got a situation . mike 's in trouble .
i wanted to say that you were right to tell pai@@ ge .
it 's got interests in local newspapers , radio .
you weren 't kidding . your guy 's got skills . i ’ ll pick up the boat this afternoon .
no . he 's talking about hard-@@ working white people .
once the insu@@ lated lower layers get warm enough ...
if you want to kill a stre@@ et@@ light without the mess and in@@ convenience of breaking into the pole with a cutting torch , you need to access the circuit breaker .
you can just yell at me .
this is not the chart house .
doesn 't matter who you are --@@ cia , fbi -- we can find you and kill you@@ just the same .
are you serious ? - i 'm dead serious .
hush , now . talking is only gonna make it hurt worse .
you 're dead . - i 'm sad .
dressed as a wizard , don 't forget . - and justin 's there , too .
you just lawyer up , shut your mouth .
what do you think ? - oh , my god .
one of my brothers is the donor .
i got to say , it feels good to do this myself .
don 't - sir . please . this is delicate high-end product .
some people prefer the gas tank .
one time l helped an old lady across the street . next day , l found a hundre@@ d-@@ dollar bill .
i 'm@@ -- i 'm@@ -- i 'm sorry . are you sure@@ -- five out of five ?
this is about what your friends and your family get .
the chances of that happening are just about zero .
i don 't know , but ... it sounds like they didn 't come alone .
it just goes round and round . and i know where it ends up ...
sam , i got an idea . give me a hand .
we 'll find west@@ en and we will finish this .
if i don 't give it to you , they 're going to kill me .
what is it that you want to see ...
oh , i don 't know . this charity stuff 's new to me .
sarah , guess what ? robert doesn 't want to have children .
y--@@ just take his shirt off . - you know@@ -- you know what ? i '@@ ll@@ -- i 'll get it , nora .

you need to act " busin@@ es@@ sas usual " until it 's over .
i 'm sally , hi . - she 's a ghost .
oh , since you put it that way --@@ no ! okay ?
no matter how much money you have .
the plan was no more meetings .
it 's 40 % alo@@ e ver@@ a . they say it 's great for burns .
we will embar@@ k on a fantasy sa@@ far@@ i ...
i 'll go get your stuff . - thanks .
it 's really all gone , isn 't it ?
maybe , but it means walking into an op completely in the dark .
well , don 't you think , as the guest , maybe it was up to you to adjust to their dynamic rather than the other way around ?
they 're shots across the bow from a guy named stan@@ ton .
and you weren 't the one who was so jacked up on pred@@ nis@@ one that you got up at in the morning and cleaned up the kitchen .
this is -- this is ken .
no , we just need to speak with him .
please , we just have to go to where they are .
it 's eddie . we need to meet now .
oh , uh , she 's ... a friend of a friend .
you know , lu@@ c never mentioned he 's half-@@ portuguese .
are you gonna let me out ?
well , that part of the world , it 's probably heroin .
what did you say your name was - roy .
since when , ki@@ p ? you have the worst re@@ fle@@ xes of all time .
michael , we covered this . the picture ?
mike ? - yeah , i don 't have a lot of time .
otherwise , he would 've done it at the chamber 's house .
your daughters are best friends , and you all have known each other most of your lives as friends .
even this , with you three g@@ anging up on me , is not ... i don 't ...
your best days are not behind you .
wow . yeah , that -- that 's not obvious at all .
so , this is sam 's storage locker . ph@@ ew !
his name 's jonathan car@@ ver , a man with the right clearance at the right company , and the only employee who doesn 't have a family , a dog , or an ad@@ t account .
because i 'm not gonna let sam take the fall for something i did .
this guy 's just having some fun with us .
and this could be you . public enemy number one .
look , scotty jason is coming back .
any idea where he went ? - yeah , i heard him run down the stair@@ well .
i mean , there 's not too many russian restaurants next to a ca@@ f ? across from a del@@ i .
you support her back , keep your balance , because we 're gonna dip .
we can do things , michael - great things , necessary things .
for more drugs . no , i want you to admit that you used me .
does this mean you 'll help ? - of course .
i was always taught " never take yogurt from strangers .
he has to make up his own mind . - yes , but you can help him with that .
wait . w@@ -what happened . w@@ - what 's going on ?
no . you still have five minutes before the next class .
i will be finished with this any day now .
no one is allowed to drink my wine until everything is in the oven . right now we 're behind schedule .
look jonathan , don 't know what you want from me .
i 've been through this before , twice .
then get a couple of the guys and go find something that will get the job done .
yeah , but then it would be a lie . -@@ exactly .
yeah , well , what about the chick who was choking on the mo@@ zz@@ are@@ lla stick ?
well , i missed working with you , man .
know what ? -- no . calm down .
i 'll see you tonight ? - okay .

we are leaving . we are leaving ! -@@ okay , jesus , ow .
saul , we gotta do something . the o@@ ja@@ i revenues are in free fall .
mom , mom , what ... what are you doing ?
the chicken really is to die for .
maybe , but you made it right . - barely .
i told them to stop , and that 's when they freaked out .
so , where does that leave us ? - square one .
you don 't have to tell me about fighting .
they 're all turning on each other .
and what we got a sense of is the size and shape and sort of just how nasty they would look on a full-@@ size animal .
call me when you find the girl .
yeah , about 20 , descen@@ ding on you at the same time , because that makes it so much easier to bond with .
jesse , when you said a getaway vehicle , i wasn 't thinking of a dump truck .
you know , i haven 't been on a lot of dates , and i really don 't know the way this is supposed to work , because we kind of skipped that part .
she called me twice already this morning .
it blocks a wide spectrum of radio frequ@@ encies , preventing people from deton@@ ating bombs by remote control .
it 's gonna be ok , i promise .
i have to find out , and i need your help .
um , what possible reason could you have for wanting all that ?
do we know what they 're after ? - no . no .
and think of how much fun it would be if we got to spend every day together like this .
forget it . - no , don 't forget it .
loving a girl who doesn 't exist .
does he know i found out about aaron ?
well , i mean , these are our basic three cul@@ pr@@ its here :
one day humans may , in fact , become the machines .
hello ? - yeah . mike , it 's me .
i was right outside that door , mike .

this is what you would see that would rule the planet .
you 're on speaker with me , the shopping twins , and evan .
when something goes wrong in the intelligence world
eddie . what do i do to thieves ?

you 're about to drag my brother .

cause don swore it was a one-@@ time thing .

as part of the pro@@ jection process , they e@@ mit x-@@ rays .
that 'd be great . - yeah . that would be great .
dude , i ’ m messing with you , bro . i put it under the rear wheel well .
thanks , mom , but they 'll be coming back . you still need to leave .
well , that would 've been okay , except it was at a tech conference and i 'm supposed to be a " tec@@ hi@@ e " .
just us . oh , that would be just heaven . heh .
but he was kind enough to help me install my home-@@ theater system .

and the women 's republican thing . you begged me for it .
what is that --a name of a horse ?
hi . - hey . are you guys early ?
they were doing the same to me .
he who seeks the queen of all knowledge , speak and be recognize .
that 'd be a prime waste of national resources .
yeah , he 's going to look for an exit and ...
you got to at least admit that you 're wrong .
want one last look at the file before you approach me@@ y@@ erson ?
ri@@ dley , my dear . what an unpleasant surprise .
he 's got a boat on the river near the 2@@ 7th avenue bridge .
we can ... we can use it .
and young , right ? that 's what you were gonna say . young .
nate , i know it 's hard sometimes being my brother .
you don 't include me , you hardly talk to me , you never told me you wanted a baby , and now you 're not telling me the truth !
what about your art stuff ? is that going in the same box ?
i ’ m buying time . i can 't let you do this - not yet .
if god could grant me one wish , it would be to deserve the opinion you have of me .
the guy in that house has a voice .
i 'm seven stories up the main ma@@ st of the so@@ ren lar@@ sen and still climbing .
? ? ? ? you 've invited every neighbour i 've ever hated to be a part of your neighbour@@ hood watch .
oh , excuse me . i 'm sorry . i don 't think you understand .
until i realized that would be no great toss .
we can assume that ca@@ hill 's working with somebody , somebody with skills .
we promised mike we 'd talk to the cops and work this through .
and ? and he 's angry . very angry .
i thought we were having a philosophical , theoretical discussion about a campaign that had information . -@@ we were . we changed the subject .
a can of paint across the wind@@ shield could blind the driver .
that 's not some@@ thing@@ you " get around to , " sam .
you should come with me . i mean , i-i have to go there anyways today , so ...
cause if i don 't , jesse goes to jail forever , and i can 't let that happen .
now , i-i know some of you must be concerned that you 've seen our faces .
hell , i 'd take you out for ten million .
just one more piece . - sarah .
uh , nothing . just a-@@ a school question .
hey . guys . guys . guys . come on . [ stops ]
if you need to escape a building that 's being locked down , speed is key .
how do you know ? - kitty , stop . please . you 're frightening me .
oh , i 'm flattered . but we both lost the big game .
listen , michael , we all know what 's at the top@@ of your christmas list .
mike was their first clean@@ up project .
why do you think he 'll get custody ?
what -- you need my help , lar ? is that it ?
cons do it for the money , and spies do it for the flag , but it 's mostly the sam e gig .
i 'm not sure if fi counts , mike .
i don 't know what 's up with bill .
then i 'm gonna be forced to use this .
so , your friends are in one of these ware@@ houses ?
scotty , if ... if it means this much to pai@@ ge ,
i hear he 's about to lose the finance chair , - so he might be a little sensitive on spending . - oh , kevin ?
her daughter rachel is the public defender in orange county ,
you want proof that i 'm not with mar@@ s@@ den ?
wow . well , that 's the kind of friend we 'd all like to have .
i-i think my mom is starting to get her hopes up .
you 're the one going to pen@@ n state .
i stole it from a coke dealer up in bo@@ ca .
that 's okay . it 's better that way , - that i give him some air . - no , no , no , no , no , no .
i 'm sorry . i saw the bottle on your desk , all right ?
[ man ] hey ! shut the valve ! the pipe is broken .
use a code that 's too simple , and it will get broken .
robinson , this bible of yours , tell me the story .
did you guys go to college together or something ?
is that meant to be sarca@@ stic , mother ?
anyway , we 'll do some quick photo ops with some local supporters at the airport and then ...
it means nothing . kitty , we 're not .
see , a science project is about science . - i beg to differ .
right , we may have to ar@@ m-@@ wre@@ stle over this .
why not ? that room is perfect .
it 's supposed to look like an accident .
all right . you 'll pop off a couple dozen rounds , show these folks you 're handy with that 9 , - and then we 'll mo@@ sey on down to the clu@@ b@@ house ... - ugh .
i have an er@@ rand i have to run .
i 'm late , but i come bearing gifts .
i prefer to live on the edge ... don 't you ?
it would be wonderful for the two of you to have some adult time , honey .

how was the drive ? - oh , it wasn 't bad .
figure out what , i may get some leverage against carla .
no , no , wade . dri@@ ll@@ bit must have done it .
you know , you just do things in a clu@@ mp
well , i better get going . but i got just one thing to say .
barry , i heard about your ex .
i 'm bored just hearing about it .
i 'm passing the ip@@ sec , sending you the i. p. address now .
it sends us their data and wi@@ pes their drives clean .
and this is it , right --@@ no more games ? i get my pension back ?
honestly , i just don 't understand the guy 's appeal .
you know what ? you go ahead . yeah . there you go .
reed 's on schedule . and satellite tracking has him headed your way .
um , i 've got to get back to work , but it 's not like you need me there anyway .
well , it 's better than history and physics .
l understand the drill － keep them waiting － but the natives are getting restless .
i just want to know how the hell they found us in the first place .
take it up with commander jackson . he brought us here himself .
you have a collect call from an in@@ mate at al@@ lar@@ od federal pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary .
now , sit down . we 're gonna go over a few things .
the thing is , his alibi checks out . i mean , i veri@@ fied it myself .
your eyes are even more magnetic in person .
after she 's dead , drew brings larry the money , and that 's when you 're gonna ...
most people don 't think of the coast guard as being particularly well-@@ armed .
my dad 's sad , my mum 's sad , you 're sad .
because my butt is killing me . - no .
so ... mom 's not here . you know , maybe she 's not coming .
then , even a season@@ ed operative will have the same response as everyone else
to be by his side and , uh , and to have given up some very real part of yourself , your own dreams , so that your mate can save the world .
the thing is , i-i kind of ...
i don 't want anyone getting hurt . - copy that .
don 't be too hard on him .
it 's all right . i ... pretended i was some helpless old woman .
i would like to go see nate 's grave one last time before we leave .
yeah . - good thing you brought that flash@@ light .
no , honey . i@@ -- i 'm@@ --i 'm too busy . i 'm sorry .
kent and melissa are going to have a little , uh , well-@@ documented transaction going on -- a buy .
i appreciate all of your opinions , but i 've told you a million times , i will not win playing dirty .
and you completely over@@ reacted to that little outfit .
now , the whole idea here is that you will do this one solo , and that way , you can re-@@ establish some kind of a trust with me .
do you have my memo for the committee ? - nope .
it 's good . we 're covered . don 't sweat it .
and she needs your help , man .
fu@@ tile , maybe , because you and your partner aren 't able to have children bio@@ logically ?
i had a friend who deals in secon@@ d@@ hand cars check it out .
no , no , no . all right , all right .
oh , and just so you know , you 're -- you 're pretty much a -- an amateur when it comes to losing game night .
how the hell did you let him escape ?
sam ! no ! oh , fi . fi ! fi .
why don 't you find something on the radio ?
and , well , technically , she 's my daughter ' cause i gave sperm to tommy and julia .
oh , my god . she 's trying to buy us time .
good , buddy . i 'll see you soon . - all right .
and did grandma tell you that kitty has the best doctors in the whole world , and they 're doing everything they can to help her and that she 's gonna be just fine ?
i 'm a junior now , am@@ ma . if i dress like i care , i lose credibility .
i think about it , i get , like , hi@@ ves .
you got a cop ti@@ pping you off ? - no , no , no , no , no , no .
no one 's asked for any money .
guys , you need to forget about the hostages . all right ?
well , come on . before sarah , i never had any good reason . - ooh .
we had a deal -- you surrender , you help with my investigation into this tom card mess .
how big do we want this ?
if you 've got a better way@@ to find encrypted pas@@ swords and account information , i ’ m all ears , baby .
i know . i k@@ n ... i had to do it .
what the － what is this ? oh . flip it like that .
then i got hit in the ear , which you prob@@ abi@@ y can 't even see , ' cause it 's so deep in the ear canal .
i know where this is headed . - don 't put words in my mouth .
stay home and eat all the frea@@ kin ' chips , ki@@ p !
not after the life you 've come to know here .
you know , catherine , most people consider a year to be the minimum waiting period .
went to the worst possible version of you .
why don 't you turn it on ?
you know , nate , i 'll bet michael 's thinking the same thing about you .
i was in my apartment . -- shh , shh , shh . mil@@ o .
i leave for ten minutes to get mac@@ adam@@ ia nuts , and it 's like you take away her will to live .
i bet you 're wearing a wire .
no . you know what you 're meant to know .
call the president of the united states of america .
there you go , honey . - elizabeth ...
she is in so much denial .
what 's going on ? look , jake . the knit@@ ting factory fell through .
let me guess . you want me to stay here , watch ben@@ ny , see what he 's up to - fine .
it 's bro@@ ward p. d. they 're coming down 75 .
he buzz@@ es around looking over everybody 's shoulder to check their progress .
i probably should 've a long time ago , but i think i ...
will you give him one message for me ?
my men are under orders to shoot intru@@ ders on sight when they remember them .
michael , i want you to meet my brilliant , ad@@ or@@ ab@@ le@@ para@@ medic boyfriend , campbell .
i go once up and down the ward and three times round every landing .
i won 't . i promise . i promise , i won ’ t . i love you . yeah .
uh-huh . okay . so which one of them called you ?
well , it 's the reason the sergeant called for an early landing and look where that got us .
but when you think about it within context that 's when it sort of all comes together , the frea@@ kin@@ ess of the magnitude of what we 're doing .
it 's hard not to look where someone 's firing , and gun@@ shots are disor@@ i@@ en@@ ting , especially at close range .
they 're about elizabeth , okay ? i 'm really sorry .
we 're here for the chips -- the , uh , passport chips .
that 's weird , not going to school .
well , now it 's my turn to tell you that . oh .
that 's what spies do , you know ?
oh , damn it. you know , that still hurts .
you know , it 's not the same when no one 's watching .
... - all right , i 'll call !
you know , like a 60@@ i@@ sh@@ -year-old woman sitting in a car .
they 're dead , they can 't sue nobody .
oh . okay , it -- -- i 'm sorry .
cake ! cake ! cake ! we only just started eating .
you just need a clean car , something to get you close so they don 't know it 's you .
my god , children have to listen to you@@ -- my children
you know , i 'm ... look , i 'm sorry .
catherine ? - i have to go , mom .
don 't tell me what i need . i 'm calling the shots here .
i haven 't really explored miami very much .
di@@ on ? what , you mean the video games and stuff ?
for reasons i don 't understand , you turned her down .
yeah , u did . -- i did not .
can 't give up , mum . mustn 't ever give up . gotta fly !
i have a little medical bag to sti@@ tch minor wounds and pull sp@@ lin@@ ters .

thank you . tell ' em we 're having dinner in here . they might want to join us .
whoa , can you make anything grow ?
she 's not gonna kill me in public . smile .
octo@@ pu@@ ses are notori@@ ously cra@@ fty and elu@@ sive .
she did it ! - it was her !
she looks like death eating a crack@@ er .
what do you think i do , mom ?
you ever see the movie ? - no .
oh , scotty , rebecca , what brings you here ?
and they lift right out of the water ...
are you guys thinking what i 'm thinking ?
when i shot card , it wasn 't in self@@ - defense .
don 't get co@@ cky . - nice shot .
both calls made were made from brooke 's cell , which has since been turned off .
it 's more like $ now .
listen , jake , this is not a job with a great future .
to better understand the origin of an alien planet tee@@ ming with these types of machines ...
that 's weird , not going to school .
okay , don 't leave till my ex@@ drives out of the driveway . i 'll call you .
i 'll call mar@@ s@@ den out . - i 'll tell him ...
no . -@@ so don 't critici@@ ze people who are .
you just -- you just che@@ ered us right up .
how ? - by serving him up for me .
okay , that 's fi . throw the swit@@ ches .
great . this is all i need .
i can only cook a few things , and the air-@@ conditioning 's i@@ ffy .
but now it just seems so sur@@ real .
okay , guys , the plan is to get under the boat and have a good
you think too much . sometimes you 've just gotta ...
mom , just@@ -- - and this is him here . i 'm gonna take the call .
luckily , you can usually count on the other guy not to let you off easy .
he likes this shirt , doesn 't ?
if that happens , we just flush ' em ourselves .
i didn 't know that she really wanted to .
um ... let 's just say that we evolved .
someone who just joined the team won 't expect an equal cut of whatever you 're stealing , and if they don 't know your plans , they can 't go to the cops .
you didn 't take that to home ec , too , did you ?
we 're not gonna let lu@@ c go without a great big fight . - four weeks ?
uh , well , dr. alex , i appreciate that kind of di@@ ligence , but not every mother has the time .
sarah , she 's your kid . so why don 't you help her ?
at least i can bear my own exile a while longer , knowing how su@@ san@@ nah 's been safe in your care .
so now you can accuse carter of being an undercover cop .
he was a lovely little boy ... like you .
please stand by to re@@ direct to fort lau@@ der@@ dale . over .
oh , she 's doing a girl scout camping weekend .
we drive off , we hand over reed to the interrog@@ ators , and you go to work .
oh , god . you know , i 'm sitting on tens of millions of dollars and trying to find the right company to buy into or buy out .
i 'm not giving up . i 'm making some calls .
right now , i 'm gonna chop these , and nothing on earth is gonna stop me .
i know . i know . it always rings .
who 's ar@@ lo ? - i 'm sure he 's there every day for lunch .
hey , rick app@@ leton . - justin walker .
stair@@ case and hallway downstairs are clear .
or did you not ? - i don 't ... i don 't remember a plan .
olivia , do you think you could look at us when we talk to you ?
neither of us should be , because we are happy , and we 're in love , and ... did you hear mom on the radio today ?
hopefully , we 'll track the guy back to where the girls are before kat@@ ya gets her hand son a blow@@ torch .
you said miami beach , right ? that 's where we 're headed ?
damn it , ful@@ ler ! what 's taking so long ?
i swear to god , if i find out you 're lying to me -@@ this might not be what it looks like .
that 's not the question , mr. axe .
uh , i did some po@@ king around the fbi .
pa@@ para@@ zzi ? my god . the world has gone mad .
please , nora , this is a million times more fun than politics , and i 'm not even following it .
i 'm gonna call the mo@@ vers , get our stuff back , and you got to call work .
because i think i can get him to talk .
robert , it 's gonna be like a fat@@ wa . checks will fly .
lu@@ c never mentioned anything to me about a film .
this is dr. karl west . thanks for listening .
then perhaps ... you 'll have a brother or sister after all .
deb@@ bie rin@@ al@@ di , the stupid love of my dumb@@ -@@ ass wasted life .
we j@@ t went straight to being lovers , then fighters .
michael , you 're gonna be outside with your gun , and you 've got the man sha@@ ck@@ led to the bed , for god 's sake .
you were in the mi@@ i@@ itary , huh ? tell me where you served .
sarah , i have to tell you , i think this game is a problem .
sam , why would you -- - i didn 't have time to do it@@ any other way .
these people are freaks of nature .
where the hell 's the - what are you looking for ?
i 'll try , but for now i need a way to find bailey .
do i get to know what it is ? - well , i guess you probably should ...
um , i 'm sure scotty told you , uh , we@@ --@@ we want to have a baby .
you know , he used to … come and cu@@ ddle and fall asleep and ...
what kind of history ? - depression .
you want some hot coffee ? - only in the worst way .
sounds like bren@@ n@@ en 's after some government-@@ funded weapon .
here you are . not too light . not too dark . just right .
i need some backup , and mike 's mind is pretty much on this whole co@@ wan business .
i-i 've been going over all these expenses from the wedding .
i goo@@ g@@ led him again . there 's this picture of him from some bo@@ ca rat@@ on society page .
and maybe it 's in this box .
and as of next week , the bank is gonna seize this land and the building .
it 's bad business , but it is the walker way .
the elev@@ ators , p.@@ a. system , and security cameras belong to me now .
oh , yes , of course . well , that 's obvious . terrific work , justin .
just how much su@@ shi@@ -@@ grade yel@@ low@@ tail has to be ruined before i can file an insurance claim ?

i can 't believe i 'm actually standing here , - talking to the gabri@@ ela lau@@ rent . - oh .

i don 't know what they talked about .
we let him coach our girls .

well , it 's ... it 's not like i sit around pic@@ turing you .
well , th ... the thing is , he 's free tonight .
a two-@@ man security team . unfortunately , you can 't go around them .
well , you set up@@ for your photo shoot here . i 'll be sun@@ bathing over there@@ in a hat .
you know , with ... with the big ta@@ ps .
and i think you 're being a ta@@ d melo@@ dramatic .
yeah . - life is too short .
it 's an accountant named ricky wat@@ kins .
it is a new job , fi , but it 's not a new life .
dad . it 's really late . you 've been working all day .
your job . - robert , i feel trapped .
at the exact time the other girls were leaving their scrip@@ ted messages , he was at the pe@@ p rally .
what kind of gun did you use ? - a fri@@ ck@@ in ' 1 2-@@ gauge . what do you think ?
but if you want to make@@ a quick phone call , put your mind at ease , i 'll wait .
and it 's not my fault that i have a pre@@ dil@@ ection for good breeding ...

do what we want or die .
that 's what i 'm asking you ! - i have a dance class !
you know what , nora ? why don 't you start the shower ? i 'll get the pants .
now , in the last year , len@@ a du@@ chann@@ es has been in three different schools ...
i ... last night she said she was having dinner with you .
it still might work , but you will die with me .
if they find out , we 'll all be dead . trust me .
anxious ? who 's anxious ? i-i should really go back to my house .
half-@@ dozen guys with a.@@ k@@ .@@ s. not something you expect to see out here .
that means we 'd have to back@@ track . why not go to the motel first ?
what 's to handle ? he 'll always be uncle ke@@ v .
none of this is my fault . - yes , i@@ is ...
thank god you 're back . sam isn 't doing well .

ur@@ n , you 'll have to excuse me . heh , i 've not been sleeping too well .

and if he doesn 't , i 'll take him out .
what have you done to him ? - invited him to dinner with the folks , is all .
no , that could have been taken hours ago .
you stood me up , so he walked me back to my room , and i spent the entire night alone in the honeymoon suite .
and - and actually , i think it took its toll .
that 's eddie . not a bad way to travel , huh ?
uh , maybe not . if you 're right about the storm drain , we might be able to save sam - right here , right now .

oh , here 's a good game . name one species that 'll miss them .
and whether or not you have liquid water .
now , there was a young woman that i hoped to marry , but i had no prospects , nothing to offer .
well , what do you call him ?
because if you don 't face the truth , tommy , you don 't move forward , you don 't grow .
i 'm not going to hurt you , okay ?
well , i 'm not gonna stop worrying about you .
no , that 's all right . wait here . i 'll be right back .
is something wrong ? - no .
he can choose ? then why can 't you ?

i 'm worried ... do you think there 's any chance that you could stop by over there and check on her today ?
well , you did drive 130 miles an hour down the ta@@ miami trail .

all of which@@ made me curious to know where the hell did you get that car from !
glad you 're getting some sleep . - am@@ ma ! how did i get here ?

don 't be silly . let 's go watch them look at him .
look , mike , i appreciate you filling in for sam on this job .
nate ! - you 're good right there .
it so damages what little credibility you have .
so that should take care of the doors .
this plan only works if riley sees me here .
i was watching her like a hawk .
uh , no . probably still a little too near for me ...
damn it . look what you did .
will you just get a cd off my dresser , please ?

no , you didn 't . you were one stupid , careless son of a bitch .
the line is out the door and down the block .
and when they do , you look ' em straight in the face and say , " ignore me if you want , but i ’ m your mother , " and i ’ m never gonna leave your life , so we might as well get to know each other .
the point is , something 's holding you back .
michael , you 're supposed to be honest with me .
it 's the pose in the photo .
oh , that v@@ c@@ r situation . -that 's right .
i don 't go to school . my mother educ@@ ates me .

fine , i 'll -- i 'll -- i 'll tell take@@ da that i injected him with drugs .
why 'd you bring your gun ? - if he doesn 't come to us , we 'll go to him .
then i ’ m who you want to talk to , using a little system i like to call the tre@@ y system .
maybe ' cause last time he was here , we had a moment .
scientists believe you must first understand ...
i 'm sorry you have to leave town again .
uh , i don 't know about you guys .
rebecca , you don 't need to do this .
if hitting a guy reinfor@@ ces your cover ...

the units .
weather " v@@ ane " seems easy enough , " gray hair " means a gray roof , and " presidential " means he should be looking for a white house .

give me those p@@ liers . going to find out what that son of a bitch knows .
if you have a beta . -what ?

this window sha@@ ttering is just the beginning .
you know , your mom carried a picture of you all the way up to the fbi academy in quan@@ tic@@ o , virginia so that me and these agents here could help find you .
there 's only one way to break the curse .
my friend melissa -- we work together .
yeah , thought you might like that .
he ... he never had a family before .
what i can show you is some footage of a hu@@ mbo@@ l@@ dt squ@@ id .
trick is , you can 't baby ' em , otherwise they get soft , like democrats .
the first guy who tells me where my friend jesse is being held is released as a sign of good faith .
we can use the cr@@ ates as cover to get closer .
so i can stay with dad .
and that ... that 's what i want for us , rebecca .
the more i think about it , that guy , he could 've really hurt me .
you know , the book , e reason that i don 't work here anymore ?
if you 've been dreaming about installing a garage … mom .

and if it 's not , well , i think you 're gonna be very grateful to both of us for coming all the way down here , believe me .
no one needs to see these , including your wife .
yeah , i know , but it 's because i kissed him back .
and we might even lose , but ...
the moon appears , and it will claim you as you are destined to be claimed .
cooper . cooper . - cooper , what are you doing ?
now is not the time to panic . do you understand ? i understand .

yeah , but i mean , come on , you used to spin things for a living , right ?
i 'm not making excuses for you . - you 've been answering questions for me all night long .
michael , you know this is the only way .
right up until julia came back .
i 'll call fi and jesse -- let them know what 's going on .
at the moment , nothing comes to mind .
romeo is mon@@ ta@@ gue . juliet is ca@@ pu@@ let .
what about you , saul ? - what , me , tested ?
we found her hiding a teenage boy in the guest bedroom , sarah .
you come down here , and then you hide behind these barrels , all right ?

miss . - miss . it had to be . enchan@@ te .
oh , my god . - there he is .
you got something to say to me , you can talk to my lawyer .
thanks , but i think he wants a little alone time with me .
you ever need anything -- i mean , anything , it 's just say hello to your brother for me .
you think you 're funny ? just watch your step .
well , where are you gonna go ?
can we just go home ? - sure .
maybe you 're not worried about jail , but i am certainly not going back !
there are enough boats and buildings there to keep them searching for hours .
but look at this . my god , scotty .
she thinks he 's going to kill her . - tell her to call the cops .
it 's not ok . don 't tell me that !
you had me going there , brother . - nice shot , michael .
maybe we should call it off ; he 's falling apart .
a lot of time and energy invested with a potential for no pay@@ day .
is everything okay ? - yeah , i 'm just a little tired .
this backpack has seen me through just about everything .
uh , i don 't know . i don 't know . he won 't tell me yet .
the day after paul 's funeral , this guy , carter , showed up .
you know what ? karl is right .
that 's okay . i got it . thanks .
she had the te@@ mer@@ ity to fall in love with a mortal ...
all you need from her is just to listen , that 's all , a place where you can talk out loud so you can hear what you really think , what you think , not ... her .
you knew that kid@@ was dead anyway .
you made me buy you a beer after bill number 8 . - yeah ?
now this is in both of our names , and you and i are the only ones who know about it .

two stupid kids i ’ d have to share my score with ?
fi and i are gonna probe these guys , see how serious they are .
my life sucks so badly , even if she says no , it 's not like i 'll have very far to fall .
and god forbid if you 're anti-@@ war , pro-@@ choice , or gay or not one of their fan@@ a@@ tical legi@@ ons of ev@@ angel@@ ical hand pupp@@ ets .
i 'll tell them we 'll think about it . mom , we 're gonna think about it .

the mix of nit@@ rate and magne@@ sium in a marine fl@@ are burns at over degrees .
the same thing happened to me trying to bring some peanuts back from k@@ har@@ tou@@ m .
and that 's all you need to know , sport .
why are you so nervous ? - i just ... i just ...
i didn 't actually say that . you said that . i just didn 't correct you .
yeah , well , that man doesn 't focus unless an international conspiracy is threatening to ruin his life .
just borrow some from the school nurse . i know she has , like , five sticks in her drawer .
our employer , moron that he was , he didn 't secure his i. s.@@ d. n.
van@@ ek is going after your business .
true . hurry up . you 're gonna be late . - yeah .
if you wanted to take the morning - oh , no , no , no , no .
this is a fight you could win , and i could sure use a win right now .
with all those tasty meals out there , why would a kra@@ ken go after a ship , which is basically a bowl of wood ?
okay . just let me deal with this .
okay . i gues i ’ m having a little trouble since rebecca left .
i just want to make my pitch .
this is a walker , isn 't it ?
let me get your change . - thanks .
you want to go play in the play@@ room with sophie and jack ?
no , stay out of sight . i ’ ll get them running . you sweep them up .
when ma@@ del@@ ine said you could help me , i was so relieved .
right ? so from now on , - hey , guys . - hey .
but i get the feeling i-@@ if i hang out with you much longer , my luck 's gonna run out .
that you 're obs@@ essing over the people who burned you even though they 're either dead or in jail ? i might have mentioned it .
i ... that was you on my voice mail canc@@ eling our date , right ?
no , i 'm sorry . this is wrong .
robert , get off the phone . i don 't care who you 're talking to .
you know , i almost wish they did know .
or else work afterwards . how long 's the chat room ?
i didn 't tell you when i decided .
i guess so . - oh , come here , you .
me ? -- well , yeah , okay , i.
i mean , i 'm down there helping out people , you know ?
i 'll go in and cut the bolt on the door and remove the object while you baby@@ sit the car and play lookout .
this won 't be as easy as we thought .
that 's not the point . i was trying to prove something .
did you get the package i sent you ? yeah , i got the package .
yeah , this boy 's not dangerous , not compared to a dirty , homeless ex-@@ soldier .
and then you got my fear of heights .
did he -- what -- do this -- something like that ?
jesus . w-@@ we got to call the cops , man .
no one in this conference ... ... is hiring .
he told me that he was gonna get a dump truck , and he was gonna hit her when she was coming home .
p. m . - whatever sam said to her worked .
hey , wasn 't that fun ? - hell , yeah .
i 've been working for you people long enough .
si@@ g 2@@ 26 . that 's an impressive piec@@ e@@ of hardware .
we can do this . - no .
you know , i thought the weird feeling in the air was just the calm
uh , mike , i 'm gonna go put together a name and a game for you .
so we 're gonna take a short break .
this is agent harris . i 'm agent lane .
yeah , your thieves aren 't hacking airport computers , jesse .
and the more focused the flames , the faster everything burns .
yeah , well , nora 's been a little wi@@ ggy recently .
what the hell is wrong with pete , huh ?
and in return , he promised jesse his life back , the life he had before you got him burned .
can you do that ? - yes . yes .
if my husband sees you here - - i understand . i 'm sorry .
well , i 'm sorry you feel that way .
i don 't know who you people are but i 'm beginning to think you 've been lying this whole time .
look ... i got dizzy , all right ?
but we can 't leave jesse in there forever while we 're hunting this res@@ nik girl down .
the tougher the security , the more valuable the information it 's protecting .
where did the man in black come from ?
please tell me you brought a copy .
there 's nothing to understand . i don 't even understand . i studied for these exams .
i got a plane to catch . - honey , it 's your plane .
you had plenty of choices . you just made th@@ wrong ones .
i told them that you were the perfect son , that you always wrote me , and you called me all the time and that the most important thing to you was family .
with your cia job ? - play@@ boy needs a sitter .
so you 're not gonna be leaving any@@ time@@ e soon ?
make sure the security can 't leave .
fi ! fi , i don 't -- no more games , michael .
there 's one way you live . you call off this hit .
don 't tell me you don 't know who bar@@ bra stre@@ is@@ and is .
mom , um , i wanted you to hear this from me .
ta@@ iling a trained operative requires a number of time-@@ consuming preparations , everything from ac@@ qu@@ iring a vehicle they can 't recognize or trace to famili@@ ari@@ zing yourself with all the local traffic patterns .
no , you , here , i just type here ?
yeah . well , you know , we 'll just have a good time . - yeah .
qu@@ enti@@ n , you need to learn to reach out .
the last thing he would want you to do is stop living your life , and if you 're trying to shame me into not wanting a comfortable future with you , then ... then you 're right , i don 't understand .
yeah , about that . i 'm keeping sam for a while .
you said you wanted it . - i do , i do . oh , i do .
you got me out of the poor@@ house , okay ?
that 's why i had to rush straight here from the airport ?
five days , you bring a sleeping bag , and you 're out by the weekend ?
he 'll talk to anyone , even strangers .
wow . oh , tell him about the , uh , the paper@@ weight .
you 're a single mom . evan 's only 3 years old .
all right , all right , all right ! it 's eight inches , all right ? - what ?
no , not yet , but it won 't be long .
you know , i have this afternoon free . maybe we could finish yours together .
she is allowed to date who@@ m@@ ever she wants .
you 're never going to understand the power of wealth and the subtle guarantees in life that come with it .
were you guys gri@@ f@@ ters ? -i wish .
someone else is taking care of that .
this is your letter of recommendation .
justin , it 's also a very big step . - yeah , but you know you love him .
sam just hired me for a job .
i 'll be with you . it 'll be okay , justin . i swear .
you know how i ended up in the joint ?
by the way , listen to them when they say get to the airport early .
nobody knows what the best treatment is .
i have a daughter who is moving forward to the next stage of her life .
i need you to meet me at tomorrow morning at dad 's old fishing spot - the one we went to when i was 12 .
i thought she was our piece of luck , our miracle .
hope your mom knows what she 's doing , mi@@ key .
you tried , and it didn 't work out , and that loss , or disappointment , as you put it , is just as real as catherine 's .
oh , no , we 've had that today , too .
feel free to check all the stal@@ ls next time you go take a leak .
whether you 're in moscow , tehran , or miami , club girls are a good source of information .
hey ! you call this table scra@@ ps ?
yeah . no , sarah , i meant it when i said it .
and thank you for inviting me to this beautiful home .
cal@@ eb , we might have a problem .
from the plant life to the larger , more complex creatures .
there 's nothing but rubber gas@@ kets here .
you are gonna look back and you 're gonna think , how the hell could my mom have been so irresponsible ?
can 't you at least cut your hour@@ ly ? i bought the snacks .
you know , i think what your un@@ cles are trying to say is that it 's learning that 's important .
i 'm , uh , just thinking out loud here , but if i wanted to steal a really valuable object , going in as a helpful s@@ oul@@ volunte@@ ering to test it might be my first move .
no , no . - you have to leave .
in fact , i can 't find a single record to confirm either of you even exist .
after what happened , she went underground .
the stronger gravity would hold a much thic@@ ker atmosphere ...
if i couldn 't work with women , i ’ d be dead right now .
i just want you to know that i understand how important kids are to you and that time is not on our side .
this is crazy to me , rebecca . - well , i don 't understand .
olivia , kevin and scotty would like to talk to you .
for , according to the weather channel , and you can verify this on google ...
and i could swear there were ... wings .
well , i want people to do more than just consider eating at our restaurant .
yes , kevin , it seems that she fixed you up with my brother , un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to both of us , and apparently , it did not go well .
so you 're gonna go on television and play the victim and search for a book deal ?
[ phone ringing in distance ]
much like a squ@@ id might shoot out a big ink cloud ...
say bye to mama ? - bye bye . i 'll see you soon .
i gotta see who this is . - mom , your publi@@ cist can wait .
now , you should take these , once a day , and i 'll get you more when they run out .
yeah , i think . uh , sort of , vag@@ u@@ ely .
yes ... like monsters in your room .
her father , peter , a wi@@ do@@ wer , left her home alone for the weekend .
of course l 'm right . go get ready .
that is , bar none , the cra@@ zi@@ est play i have ever heard in the field .
i don 't know what she knows , but it 's probably a good idea for you two to steer clear of me for a while .
well , i ’ ll buy the drinks . - then you can definitely sit your ass down .
li , in good conscience , i can 't
trust me or don 't . it 's your choice .
yeah , well , i was nearly chopped to bits , almost blown up , and was shot today .
oh , you know what ? i canceled it . i@@ -- you know , i just
you all couldn 't wait to run over me , to take my position , to take my life ...
yeah . she just turned down@@ sher@@ man way .
turns out that the phone used to call the village tracks to a hotel on south beach .
michael , what the hell is going on ?
you know , you know , those buttons on the microwave are awfully confusing .
ok , first of all , you 're beyond doors , babe .
realize that in the coming centuries ...
no , it sounds like some horrible , right-@@ wing , milit@@ ant , gun@@ -@@ to@@ t ...
oh , well , i told you not to wear those cute little shoes hiking .
all you can do is tell your side of the story and hope for the best and know that no matter what you do , your fate lies in someone else 's hands .
it 's my wife , calling to complain about something or other . it 's her specialty .
will you watch him till the nanny gets here ?
if you can convince your enemy to want the very thing it 's as good as calling the shots yourself .
are you sure you 've got everything ?
you should probably come get it ， ' cause i can 't fit my nun@@ cha@@ k@@ us in there anymore .
good news is she 's got your back .
either way , we have to tell ma@@ del@@ ine .
so , so , what 's your name ? -- ken junior .
kevin , your with mr. bal@@ anch@@ ine is here .
yeah , i 'll take care of him .
oh , apparently , your dear , def@@ lowered little girl would 've screwed my husband in a heartbeat .
fine . i am here because i gave part of my liver to eli@@ z@@ ab@@ h .
oh , sarah , i 'm so happy for you .
and so we just slipped back into our comfort zones .
i 'll text you later . and work on that hook shot .
come on , come on . click " shoes " while you 're thinking .
yeah , wade , boys , you really shouldn 't have panicked like that .
i 'm gonna take my hand off your mouth again .
first word ... sounds like ... sister . mister .
i 've already done " meet the press , " " this week " ,
i 'm sorry . i know . i know this hurts .
mom , this is not a bus to vegas , okay ?
i 've been running the name by all my friends .
so does the offer still stand ? - yeah .
so you know what ? this might be a blessing in disguise .
what did you do with the files ?
i like it . i like it very much .
you sp@@ un a web of lies to cover your ass .
um , ch ... oh , never mind . got it .
jealous , fi ? - don 't be absurd . i 'm not jealous .
actually , i didn 't know marilyn until yesterday .
you said fi 's out with cody , right ?
you remember you wore that costume to studio 54 ?
you get the first crack at west@@ en , but you better make it good .
is it that bad ? - pear@@ ls ?
anywhere . go ahead . you name it . - okay , good .
you 're gonna take your shirts off . you can do it in sk@@ ins , right ?
dear mom , if you 're reading this , it 's very possible that i 'm dead .
i think we would really wow the judges .
you stole the files from the island . where are they ?
why are you shouting ? - i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry .
i 'm just trying to do what 's best for elizabeth .
i just need that one last piece , michael .
is that cool with you , earl ? - it 's no problem .
well , that was definitely more serious than the cheese lady .
indeed i do , but i 'm more than capable of eating by myself .
bad guys , like most people , aren 't big on checking the details in legal documents , which makes fine print a powerful weapon for a spy .
actually , i was looking for kitty , and she doesn 't seem to be answering her phone , and i found , uh , your number on this contact sheet that she left here , so .
it circles around a little red dwarf .
this is half grown ? this is only half grown , yeah .
nora , look at the size of the thing . -- yes , i see .
what 's going on , tommy ? - we 're leaving . now .
after that , i ’ m 20 bucks richer .

yeah , but this isn 't a desk .
listen , let me tell her , okay ? i 'm gonna see her tonight .
jesus . you think mi@@ key '@@ su@@ kra@@ ini@@ an made his move already ?
and the chemistry that we think leads to the origin and evolution of life ...
well , i think the balls are in your court .
dele@@ tes his text messages . there 's no contacts list , either .
i 'm a homeless u. s. army deser@@ ter . i was ...
oh , i-i 'll see you tomorrow , okay ?

he 's gone , mike . and we lost our only lead .
uh , i was actually here . i ’ m on my way back down to the city .
do you mind if i come in ? - no .
okay , so how do i make it up to you
but what would happen on a world where there was even more water a lot more ?
are you sure we 'll be able to see the house from here ?
even last year , even with william 's death , am@@ id@@ st it all , tre was always this sense of ...
exactly the same . - word for word .
and she 's not gonna find out . - i 'm sure she 'd understand .
and we will wait and wait in that space .
just open a joint bank account with mike and a mayor 's ai@@ de .
not you kids . please , go to class . go , go , go . get away from me .
come on , daddy ! -- okay . okay .

francis and i are now 55 ' up , about the sixth floor of an office building .
we may only get one chance at this .
karl had the most wonderful book signing today .
see me ? - there you are .
the people who shot co@@ wan are probably watching her place .
i guess you know why we want to talk to you .
okay , well , that 's a problem , see , ' cause if ed finds out about this car , he 'll know where his wife is .
lu@@ c , darling , you were amazing . - me ?
and i didn 't think what i did was heroic .
you of all people can 't let that happen . - and if i don 't do it , you ...
stay away from that girl . - you don 't need to take care of us , am@@ ma .
mm , carla said you might be difficult .
she was closing in , and ... did i mention her eyes ?
old school -- you know i like that .
michael west@@ en getting married . - boy , that 's a good one .
you ran for the united states senate .
enough of this " do whatever it takes " crap .
it 's an event where potential parents can meet and interact with children who are looking to be placed into families .
that 's what i was trying to protect you from .
oh , and guess what . - what ?
i just needed to know how connected strick@@ ler is .
okay , well , that lock will hold them for a bit , but , mike , van@@ ek sure seems motivated .
you boys are goin ' down . - yeah , make it four .
uh , no . he has a girlfriend .
i just wanted to say thanks for offering to help .
and that 's how these organisms must have felt .
julia 's in trouble . - you 've been here 24 hours , and you think you know what 's going on ?
all units report in . - you hear that , west@@ en ?
yeah , absolutely . - oh , thank you .

some guy from the nsa . - the nsa has a leak ? i want a name .
i take it you 've never been tested before .
what ? what is it ? - go . just get in the car .
she hasn 't got one yet . mum and dad haven 't had time .
or ... you could walk back in there with your head held high
you know what this looks like now is an unexpected dro@@ p-@@ in from michael west@@ on .
michael , i-i know i said that i would go along with you@@ on this job , but i don 't want you@@ to work with strick@@ ler ...
you 've already decided that i 've done something inappropriate , so why don 't you just go ahead and punish me ?
not really . but it could be .
they didn 't even have time to lock up .
i don 't care what it is .
yeah , but now is not the time to cut corners .
it 's like squee@@ zing juice from a stone .
schmidt told you those passport chips were un@@ trac@@ eable , right ?
how far out are we ? - three minutes away .
yeah , not so fast . i have a few conditions .
yes ! he has a sa@@ mur@@ ai sword - he has used on his other victims ! - all right ...
mom shouldn 't drive herself down there . she 'll break the land speed record .
it 's a little like being in high school .
i began sailing forty years ago
now , until we find out whether or not mr. ca@@ hill was working alone , we will assume that our radi@@ os have been compromised . is that clear ?
what , you don 't think amy -- i mean , come on , she 's , like , my special lady .
kevin , i can barely hear you .
so , he wanted maya to move ? yes , but she didn 't want to .
if you ever found , you know , a 100 ' kra@@ ken that had the strength that an octo@@ pus has , that would just be an absolutely fear@@ some beast .
yeah , well , that was 10-@@ plus years ago , and i 'm still not over it .
all right , i 'm going to add the squ@@ id fin@@ s , but i 'm going to keep the octo@@ pus arms just ' cause they
slice ' em , dice ' em , rue ' em .
give me those . - okay you need to ease up on the attitude .
so , um , you all have your men@@ us .
oh , saul , saul , you could marry him . - yeah , i could marry him .
she after an endor@@ sement from hi@@ x ?
i don 't have the time to put this little a. m.@@ radio thing in my life .
if those guys are planning on getting to her here , you 're just gonna have to find another way , right ? thanks .
their main vulner@@ ability is that they depend on people 's faith in pad@@ locks .
sam and jesse are already inside .
it 's not like that . - yeah , really ? it seems like that .
you want to live the rest of your life in a shack in cuba ?
sorry , but i just have to put my killer hook to the test and see how much damage it can do , something the estee@@ med nov@@ eli@@ st victor hu@@ go contemp@@ lated back in 18@@ 66 .
sarah , the only person who had cancer in our family was daisy .
you mean , with no clothes on ? with his tackle hanging out ?
how was it having all those little kids look up to you ?
wait , mom , how have i never seen this movie ?
all it would take is a few pictures with the wrong woman ...
stay there . you turn around like this . okay ?
enter michael west@@ en , a.@@ k. a.@@ matt graham .
you didn 't hear my children calling in trying to save their mother from embarrassing herself , did you ?
i 'll tell you where he is .
we 're investigating an incident that occurred last week .
jackson expected you to kill us .
let me go ! help ! - stop fighting .
ful@@ ler , do not take the shot . i repeat , do not take the shot .
i 'll go along with which@@ ever you decide .
let 's see what we can do , okay ?
all you can do now is look towards the future .
sarah and i are pretty convinced that kevin is not gonna be coming to dinner .
david , look me in the eye .
oh , mike 's in a bit of a bind .
now are you gonna stand for his legacy to be s@@ lan@@ dered by these people ?
on three . one , two ... - put the gun down .
i 'm sorry ... which one ? - lemon@@ ade is good .
i 'm not leaving you ! michael , i 'm not afraid ! - mom , please !
oh , tuesday . - what , that 's not good ?
thank you , that was ... really sweet .
you think he reported us with tele@@ pathy ?
it won 't be long before they set up a perimeter and block the cau@@ se@@ ways .
the mercury ful@@ minate in a bla@@ sting cap gives you the perfect amount of explosive to send the message loud and clear without killing the vehicle or anyone in it .
did i say , " big brains " ? maybe i should qualify that , mr co@@ ot .
since i 've got here , i 've either been co@@ ddled like some half-@@ wit or strai@@ ght-@@ out insul@@ ted .
and this is something i have to work through myself .
lu@@ c , you said that you would keep an eye on him while i got changed .
we 'll find out if you 're lying right now .
i ’ m trying to re@@ en@@ act our — our first date .
if you have a. -i 'll kill you .
everybody knows - do me a favor@@ - shut up .
hey . hey , come on up here .
well , i wish kevin felt like that .
kevin , don 't be weird . - sorry .
he 's like all the men in my life .
so far it 's looking a lot like an octo@@ pus .
i just ... i-i don 't think i feel comfortable trying to convince him to take drugs .
three men there . password -- ni@@ hon@@ to . hurry !
it 's because of her - her ... vulner@@ ability .
she felt like she had to not want to .
i do , okay ? but i can 't help it .
that 's probably why william had you followed .
you did a lot of things i didn 't understand .
you remember your old neighbor , raymond mo@@ sley , also known as sugar ?
you know , i would keep him off the leg for a while , and he 's gonna hate you , he 's gonna fight you on it , but it 's best if he doesn 't put any pressure on it for at least two weeks .
so ... think about what your mom would tell you .
two boring hours of driving later , even the shar@@ pest killing machine lets down his guard .
maybe you should draw me a picture of the map to that park .
just take them . they 'll make you feel better .
listen , um , anti@@ ques lover , i ... i hate to say this , but it sounds to me like you and your girlfriend are just ... not a good match .
maybe we can put something together and blow through one of these walls .
but it was always about william walker and nothing else .
all right . look , i 'm gonna go help mommy .
w ... well , yes , robert , of course . that 's what we 're doing here .
then why don 't you go make us some tea ?
i don 't know who or why , but it 's the only explanation , ' cause your men are the only ones with access .
ma@@ del@@ ine , it 's good to hear your voice .
this should make you feel better ， it 's gonna take time to make sense of the information .
would you like to sit down , olivia ?
imag@@ ine@@ your white blood cell@@ s@@ are hur@@ t@@ ling towards a cancer cell " ...
well , then , we 'll have to think of something clever , sam .
that didn 't always sit right with kelly .
you just figure a way to get there . i 'm on it . thanks , mike .
holly . just out of curiosity , when we last spoke , um ,
now that i know your side of the story , i want you to know ...
the guy who studied it most is steve o '@@ she@@ a , an authority on all things squ@@ id .
of course , that 's the same reason that spies live in fear of the day they accidentally accuse one of the good guys
justin . - i ’ m kidding . you 're gonna be amazing .
they 're into the whole car@@ ro@@ t-@@ and-@@ stick thing , and ...
you said he worked in maintenance .
you know spies -- a bunch of bit@@ chy little girls .
but you guys don 't know who i am .
what do you think he would do if he found out about this ?
relax . the tracker says they 're getting to the motel right about now .
um , really ? that 's funny . ' cause i think i just heard you talking .
i thought we agreed - fiona , it 's like i told you before .
a warehouse door is going to be reinfor@@ ced , but the walls aren 't .
she said robert 's gonna be all right .
come on , man , look , we know you brought di@@ on 's items into the paw@@ n@@ shop .
riley took him into custody and threw out the rule book .
look , i was hoping to get you home in a couple days , but that doesn 't look like it 's gonna happen .
what , you think i 'm taking you to quinn ?
damn it ! - can we stop it ? just stick something in it ?
and i can 't imagine how it feels for them .
i would be very careful if i were you about ma@@ ki this any worse .
yeah . so you wanna grab some lunch or something ?
i was the chick singer , and i never really knew what to do with my hands , so i picked up a guitar and learned enough chor@@ ds to fake it , but that 's about it .
what are you insane ? we 're not going anywhere near there .
ah , i looked for you at the announcement .
knock it off , both of you !
you cooperate -- i 'll let you live . you don 't
this is scary as hell , dude .
okay . yep , do it . thank you .
oh , really ? - yeah , it is , don .
we can 't . we go in now , the bad guys will see us coming a mile away .

i 've given up the senate seat .
no , no , no , karl , sit down . sit down . sit down .
i 'd like to , but i don 't know why i should help my@@ ron .
his name is tyler bren@@ n@@ en , a black@@ -@@ market trader .
oh , great . we 'll call him vin@@ ny .
ful@@ ler called from the control tower .
you got a better idea ? -yeah .
but i 'll never make enough money for her , so i 'll start drinking ...
good one , ron ! - come on !
she died while i was in here .
what are you talking about ? i have ... i have directed a staff .
yeah , believe it or not , it is the approved name - for the hormone that causes our fi@@ ght-@@ or-@@ flight respon@@ se@@ .- really ?
i 'm already hearing this crap about kitty using my plane to campaign around the state .
he 's our best chance to get wilson . without him , we got nothing .
i 'm just glad it worked . - come on , get up ! shoot them !
ou@@ tre@@ ach . how can i help you ?
before you start yelling at me , will you just ...
earth to van@@ der@@ wall . why isn 't jackson still here ? think about it , man .

uncle ab@@ ner , we are in need of your inter@@ ces@@ sion .
j@@ us ! - well , if it isn 't tiny tim .
i 'm@@ -- i 'm really sorry . - no , no , fine , go .

mike , look , i can swee@@ ten the pot on this .
signal 's coming from right over there where that garbage can is .
you know , i drove him everywhere .
he could have trouble walking , running ...

because when one door closes two others open .
she has her own line . she 's looking for investors .
they took everything that she has .
a spec@@ k@@ led brown animal with a broad head and arms that fluctu@@ ate like sea@@ weed .

he 's been in a private treatment facility since birth and adam@@ son has never publicly recognized him .
you know , i-i 'm late for work . i 'm already two days behind on this commercial .
i mean , i might be a little busy walking rebecca down the aisle .
at the end of this , you 'll look like the only operative who wasn 't on the take .
well , we would love to be as involved as , as you would let us .
look a little ju@@ mpy , tre@@ vor , you 're not nervous , are you ?
she has a disease , an illness , called lymp@@ homa .
when i say " hot water , " i mean the poor guy 's been dis@@ memb@@ ered .
in theory , but i think that we should choose a date today .
she 's following in our footsteps , nora -- five children .
you might only have a few seconds ,
oh , great . he 's a little jit@@ tery .
the swee@@ test nec@@ tar . food of the gods .

everything you felt then , everything you feel now .
you think i 'd turn on him for no reason ? !
it 's gonna be a long day . let 's go , ke@@ v .
no , i mean , she must think i 'm , like , some kind of stalker .
how bad is it ? - i 'll be fine .
drawing makes you look at the world more closely .
sometimes when you meet a new operative , it 's a good idea to open with an aggressive move .
you got some death wish or something ?
maybe the kra@@ ken thinks this boat is a whale .
i know sometimes you have to shout to be heard around here .
we can 't let him do this . - i ’ m gonna confront him with it today .
blin@@ ding whatever creature came up to it .
i talked to justin about it , and@@ -- and i wanted to tell you .
good . get her on the phone , jimmy .
modern ni@@ ght-@@ vision go@@ ggles provide vi@@ sibility in near total darkness , adapt to changing light conditions , and provide better contrast and resolution than the human eye , which is why most assa@@ s@@ sins aren 't just confident in the dark , they prefer it .
don 't be stupid . i haven 't taken your beers .
free mo@@ ji@@ to for anyone who can tell me if the vene@@ tian cau@@ se@@ way 's
they must feel like they 're being sold , like pupp@@ ies in a window .
he said the peop@@ le@@ he works for -- they have plans for me .
they don 't make them like that in be@@ an@@ town .
before my dad died , he made me promise that i would protect my mother , and i 'm not gonna let him down .
the sisters can get their hands on pretty much anything .
looks like you won 't be needing this .
no , my project fell apart . yours didn 't .
tell me -- are you sure you 're not lost , english la@@ ss like yourself ?
for a brief time not too long ago .
look , i don 't know , but he already has a father , who , by the way , is not exactly thrilled about you , and obviously , neither is cooper .
batt@@ ling storms , s@@ wells , f@@ earing death by ten@@ tac@@ le .
no , but that 's probably ' cause i still have my job as a united states senator .
you want me to believe that you just called up the atlanta p. d. and they gave you the file ' cause what ?
you trying to make me shoot you ?
of course you will , bren@@ n@@ en . she 's your family .
look , she 's , like , the child whi@@ sper@@ er , okay ? let her focus on cooper .
military units are a lot like marching bands .
rebecca , like , w - we just got married .
no one will ever know what happened to us , we 'll starve to death and no one will ever know .
you don 't think ro@@ th would ever get arrested for selling cocaine ?
when you 're pursuing someone , it 's tempting to focus exclusively on over@@ taking the other person .
well , you know , trying to be the perfect family for some republican operative my mom has the ho@@ ts for is making me a little nervous .
and whatever happens , happens . - hey .
as much as i 'd like to say it 's a bad move , right now , it 's our only move .
no . no , no , no . it 's ... justin , it 's no big@@ gie .
they will come after her hard .

the way we were , " bar@@ bra stre@@ is@@ and .
don 't do anything stupid and no one gets hurt !
you haven 't lost all your cases .
wait till you see the robot start dancing .
oh , god , that was so -- do you remember ? you were so funny .
didn 't think about her once i bit it .
some things just need to stay separate .
and if i don 't like living with you , i can 't change my mind and come back here ?
you know , before you , i was fine .
it looks to me like something was about to go down here .
anyway , you 're the one who 's turned getting lucky into an art form .
i made a , uh , terrible fool of myself last night at my girlfriend 's house .
i understand you 're gonna go with co@@ ad because he 's the depen@@ dable party guy , someone you can count on , but if i 'm any kind of example , you can expect the same from robert .
actually , i think that , uh , something mi@@ ght@@ calm me down a little .
happy ? now , get in the damn car .
did he also mention my little fail@@ -@@ safe ?
get used to the pain , mate .
but inside these oceans , they could be tee@@ ming with life .
that 's weird . - it is weird .
but not kill the neighbors . - really ?
and@@ -- and while you may or may not still want to be a part ...
and then i met ... roger , and he talked to me all night .
well , he was old and he couldn 't move easily .
well ... well , answer it . - well , i ... i don 't want to .
and since charlie 's been born , i ’ ve been trying to keep my nose clean .
eh , i 've fired you before . - true .

yeah , i know . lyn@@ n 's was absurd . i mean , imagine 20 colle@@ ge-@@ educated ...
yeah , well , maybe i 'll drag your ass back to that road as a peace offering .
hey , um , so , harvey , were you able to put toge@@ ther@@ that list of irri@@ ga@@ tion@@ specialists ?
ooh , that 's a big can open@@ er !
well , you both have very different cultural references .
sweetheart , are you all right ? - i 'm fine . i just always keep checking to see if it 's swelling .
i mean , don 't you miss someone ?
listen , honey , um , grandma 's gonna pick you up and take you shopping for your party dress .
so i did a little , uh little po@@ king around on the drug bust database .
the first is to accept failure and ab@@ ort the mission .
hey , jesse , we have a hostage situation .
the guy 's a suspect in a half a dozen hits , but we don 't have so much as a description on the guy .
it starts as soon as i get the fbi file on my brother 's murder investigation .
oh , my . did you ever meet him , kitty ?
he 's kinda cute , huh ? - no . absolutely not .
these highly ten@@ acious life forms are known as extre@@ mo@@ phil@@ es .
mom 's hot for a republican . -@@ stop it !
i 've already taken over his contacts in china and the yemen , and i 'm closing a deal with the south koreans even as we speak .
no need to worry , ma 'am . we just need to know if you 've heard from him .
well , you put it all together , it makes sense .
i don 't care what he was saying . i care what you were saying !
whoever 's coming after me might have eyes on it , so i 'll drive you and nat@@ e@@ up to fort lau@@ der@@ dale , and that 's where i 'll ... find you another car .
you just remember , them as can dance should dance .
i want you to look at the men in the picture and tell me if you see the man that did this to you .
destroying high-tech electronics with glori@@ fied camping equipment is tough but not impossible .
jesse : and then we were supposed to , uh , meet up in the ever@@ gla@@ des .
what 'd he say ? - nobody ’ s missing carter yet .
the prototype legs that can susp@@ end a huge body .
a force can be so overwhelming that no tactical approach in a fight is going to lead to a victory worth having .
good for you . - yeah . it is good for me .
and you deserve better than a life in prison .
kevin , what are you doing ? - i 'm sorry .
i woke up at a. m. to an in@@ fo@@ mer@@ cial promising to cut the time it takes to peel an apple down to mere seconds .
and you can 't tell the cia about any of this because they 're not my biggest fans .
carter 's never been arrested , he 's from out of town , and he 's moving up the ladder pretty fast .
uh , as long as it 's before midnight .
i don 't think it 's healthy to keep files on the people who ruined your life .
i 've always remembered what you told me .
well , george s@@ za@@ mos said he set up a meeting with you ...
i 'm going to catch your friends , mr. axe .
you think he 's undercover ? - da - how long you known this carter guy ? - no way . there 's no way he 's a cop .
well , sometimes , mom , you gotta let up .
these are the si@@ a@@ me@@ se que@@ ers i 've been telling you about !
yes , there are evil ca@@ sters , ethan .
is he@@ - just@@ --i need you to get back , please .
i ’ m calling my guys . i got somebody at the port with a boat .
i have to keep moving , me .
he 's moving up the ranks pretty quick . the guy 's a real pit bull .
what ? - the ... the bag sold out .
well , he was at your ma 's house when i got there .
man , like ward said , we checked this building .
there 's another one coming in this week .
should we do the bathroom again ?
guys , if van@@ ek is here , we need to leave right now !
listen , i know you 're not thrilled about supporting sarah , but i really think it 's good , cheap advertising .
justin , i want this opportunity . this is a huge step forward for me .
you two are in a lot of trouble .
but all it says is : " robinson , son of a stranger .
don 't you look pretty . - ethan ?
i mean , if you really want to find a new place , you know , you 're gonna have to eventually go inside one , sam .
that 's because he 's killed most of them , mike .
oh , well , what day did you res@@ che@@ du@@ le it for ? maybe i could go with you .
the stran@@ gest of the airborne creatures one could imagine ...
it 's always useful to be able to dis@@ able a car remotely .
you know , i am happy to tell you about my past .
uh , here are your car keys . - oh , great .
how 's your dance with co@@ wan going ?
that extend , 30 feet into the air ...
pai@@ ge , look at that ! it 's gigantic .
and on the surface , ice , a lot of ice ...
well , you have to take this with a grain of salt .
you know , like foreign guys who want a con@@ do@@ for their girlfriend .
who are you kidding , ryan ? you can 't spell " su@@ do@@ ku , " much less play it .
it 's all right , robert . - kitty ! kitty ! oh , no , no .
you know , it would save me a lot of time if we just did this all at once .
i 'd never doubt one of them .
is he still in o@@ ja@@ i ? - yes .
cable 's tight . what do i do now ?
he 's gonna come around . - mom 's right . he ... he ... he 's gonna come around . you 'll see .

and to give them my blessing .
when it doesn 't work , comman@@ dos get killed just as dead as anyone else .
meet me out back in five minutes .
the world was different then . it was a lot less toler@@ ant and ...

look , these tur@@ ks -- they 're into drugs , human smuggling , murder , you name it .
yeah , well ... they don 't call me " tur@@ bo " for nothing .
special forces ? what are you talking about ?
now when lu@@ c was small , what was the one dish you would cook for him that was his absolute favorite ?
to give life to the one she loved .
well , it seemed like a good idea at the time .
you 're in charge , but we 're both in danger .
maybe he could rec@@ ou@@ p a little revenue .
a lot of people would 've said f.@@ d.@@ r.
it 's just that simple . now , i want you to kick me .
no . god , no . i can 't go up against dr . alex .

hu@@ tch , do you mind if i
you know how she loves these things ,

mac@@ on said this was the only way to protect you both .
no . actually , i talked with yel@@ ena who talked to lauren who 's engaged to joe .
and that 's where these come in ?
he certainly seemed to know he had the time .
whether nate 's meeting ends in a bullet or a hand@@ shake is entirely up to you .

my job is to find one , catch it , and get it on@@ board our boat for a close@@ -up look .
i used to dream that you would sleep past . here you go .

designed to scare us into oil exploration .
but you guys aren 't seeing the silver lining here .
yeah , well , that wouldn 't be the first time , luci@@ fer .

where the hell is he going ? - you know , i don 't know .
but we 're meant to be together !
chris , can you give us a minute ?
how did it go ? - oh , it was fun .
that was enough . - why are you mad at roger ?
wow . that 's great . yeah . well , besides the fact that it 's a huge space ...
i 'm not gonna break anyone 's heart .
she 's excited . she thinks her family 's gonna be together again .
maybe you should 've thought of that before you cheated . - yes , i should have .
i do , rebecca . i know you better than you think .

i mean , i 've got a busy schedule ... no , okay , annie ... and i-i 've got things .
uh , the li@@ gam@@ ents are all repa@@ ired , however , there 's still nerve and tissue damage .
that said , you try a little harder with some civilians than others .
actually , i understand he 's a bit of a gun nut , which means he 's less likely to call the cops and more likely to just shoot you .
oh , yeah . well , she never loved k@@ lu@@ ve the way we did .
i -- i was supposed to be interviewing the frater@@ nity brother and
let me go ! she 's more powerful than you .
oh , wow . that 's good . - yeah , it is .

oh , damn it , schmidt 's pinned down . - they 're at the southeast door .
quinn 's not coming to see you .
is the first thing that 's made me not think about robert so much .
if it 's got a battery , it 's disposable , short-term .
oh , and how much is that gonna cost ?
it 's all right , it 's all right , len@@ a . - no .
... i hadn 't seen that in a long time .

i 've already put a depo@@ sit@@ on a block of 30 rooms at the ha@@ kal@@ ea re@@ gency .
cause ever since the funeral ... - no , no , i really am .
but that 's no reason to bad@@ ger you into doing something you 're just not ready to do .
number two , actually , but that 's still high enough to make our weekly po@@ d@@ cast .
i 'll get round to it , i promise .
some of the most important secrets in the world have been protected by a guy with a few stories and a drink in his hand .
when a child finds out there 's a real possibility they 've found a home , it can trigger a lot of anxiety .
we 're supposed to be on the same side , not in here b@@ ick@@ ering with each other ! what can you
it 's the same thing . did you wear leather ?
what , is there a mor@@ at@@ orium on compassion around here ?
see , you 're way ahead of me .
are you sure you entered the right race , robert ?
no . it 's a disturb@@ ance in the force .
you know what ? i 'm just gonna peek in there and make sure it 's not the good china .
all right , well , i-i guess i can 't let that plane land .
hey , fi . don 't be a hero here , all right ?
so , to what do i owe the pleasure of this invitation ?
all i did was show them who they really are , what they were truly capable of .
cause if you 're ta@@ kin@@ gh@@ er side on this whole cholesterol thing , it 's gonna put a serious strain on our friendship .
and you 're the closest thing i 've got to a neighbour .
i was hoping you could get it for me . - you mean steal it for you .
i 've been trying to be a grow@@ n-@@ up .
if they 're dumb , you trick them .
my powers will be claimed for either the light or the dark ...
so when you hurt his feelings , you hurt my feelings , the same way that i 'd be hurt if somebody hurt you .
i thought , " finally . finally , he wakes up . finally , the kid gets it . "
you 're a man who knows what he wants . trust me .
i sang a med@@ ley from grease , including the sandy numbers .
looks like you 're going to bleed a little bit more . now shut the hell up .
oh , it 's the old " we 're all in this together " ?
emily , shut up . - my mama says the same thing .
don 't pretend you 're some kind of boy scout , michael . i know better .
we 've been monitoring traffic feeds on roads into the ever@@ gla@@ des .
i 'd also love to know why somebody who 's normally so@@ careful to keep his mouth shut has suddenly blo@@ sso@@ med into such a story@@ teller .
he was a doctor in the army . and he went to , um ... where 'd you go ?
all right , new rules ! - okay .
yeah , mike . uh , we got to talk .
good . then get back to visu@@ alizing fireworks .
i 'm not gonna have any time .
by the way . why don 't you try pre@@ serving the one that starts with " all men are created equal " ?
you fall apart , eri@@ k , and i swear to god
the thing is , my shift just ended , so i was just about to leave .
we need to grab whatever we can at the storage unit , switch cars and find out where the hell sam is .
i know simon gave you an explanation , but i found something out about him .
did you know that ? - of course i know that .
that was brian . he 'll be here any sec .
pull it from o@@ j@@ al and transfer it into your personal account and make an offer .
i don 't even have any good skills . - what do you mean ?
you mean mouth . no , i think it 's teeth . point is , you never cut out tre@@ y .
you didn 't have to stand in line .
well , you know , the problem is , is i don 't want to shout .
[ muff@@ led ] come on , boys . move it or lose it . let 's go .
green@@ at@@ op@@ ia ? - it '@@ s.@@ it '@@ s.@@ it 's nothing . it 's just my son .

when someone on your team gets a surprise , you have to hope they realize there 's a plan in motion and they can find a way to be part of it .
i 'll drain my accounts . i have enough .
where 's the ice machine ? - sir , you need to go back to your room .
back into your psycho@@ - melo@@ dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ -@@ romantic . - " psycho@@ -@@ melo@@ dramatic " ?
well , maybe this isn 't the right time to be sensible .
it 's good to have you back on the team .
okay . then tell us . who are you ?
i 'll just go in front of the board , tell them i think you did the right thing .
that in order to get life off the ground on a planet ...
